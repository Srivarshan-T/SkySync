 
# SkySync

**SkySync** is a weather app that provides real-time weather updates and forecasts through a sleek, user-friendly interface. Built with React and Vite, SkySync offers fast performance and an intuitive design for checking weather conditions on the go.

## Project Overview

SkySync pulls weather data from a third-party API to display current conditions, hourly forecasts, and daily summaries. The app is designed to be responsive, making it perfect for mobile and desktop devices.

## Key Features

- Real-time weather data and forecasts.
- Interactive user interface.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.
- Geolocation support to automatically detect the user's location.

## Installation Process

Follow these steps to set up **SkySync** locally:

### Step 1: Create a New Vite App

1. **Install Vite (if you don’t have it yet)**:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest skysync --template react
   ```
   This will set up a new Vite project named `skysync` with a React template.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd skysync
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Step 2: Replace the `src` and `public` Folders

1. **Delete the existing `src/` and `public/` folders** in the newly created Vite project:
   ```bash
   rm -rf src/ public/
   ```

2. **Copy the `src/` and `public/` folders** from the **SkySync** repository and paste them into the `skysync` project directory.

### Step 3: Install Missing Dependencies

If your **SkySync** app uses additional libraries or dependencies, you’ll need to install them. Check your `src/` files for any external libraries, and install them:

For example:
```bash
npm install react-router-dom axios
```

### Step 4: Update the `.env` File (if applicable)

If your **SkySync** app uses any environment variables (such as an API key for weather data), create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary variables:

Example `.env` file:
```
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Step 5: Run the Development Server

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the app running locally.
